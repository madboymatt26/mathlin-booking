---

## Public Booking System
- Interactive availability calendar with blocked-date indicators
- Booking form with real-time, tier-aware cost calculation
- Single, multi-day, and full-day (all-day) bookings
- Overnight booking handling (a 22:00→02:00 block counts as one continuous session, not two days)
- Recurring weekly bookings (up to 52 weeks)
- Conflict detection that prevents double bookings, including parent/child space bundling
- Configurable minimum-notice period
- Admin-configurable custom form fields ("Additional Information" section)
- Terms & Conditions acceptance checkbox
- Public/private event visibility toggle
- Scout Use (free) bookings for verified volunteers

## Customer Accounts (Hirer Portal)
- Self-service registration and login (`[mathlin_portal]`)
- Dashboard showing all bookings, invoices, and payment status
- Pre-filled booking form for returning hirers
- Quick account creation after a first booking
- Booking status lookup (`[mathlin_status]`)
- Self-service modification and cancellation requests
- Registration rate-limiting (5 per IP per hour)

## Pricing & Tiers
- Configurable bookable spaces with hourly and daily rates
- Kitchen add-on pricing (toggle on/off)
- Tiered pricing (Standard / Community / Commercial, with configurable multipliers)
- Optional explicit per-tier rates per space (`rate_hourly_[tier]`, `rate_daily_[tier]`)
- Per-user tier assignment via WordPress profile
- Custom price override for ad-hoc arrangements
- Four cost calculators kept in sync (PHP source of truth + 3 live JS previews)

## Deposits & Payments
- Deposit management (configurable percentage, configurable balance-due window)
- `deposit_paid` booking status and deposit-aware checkout
- Payment tracking via `amount_paid` (drives balance-due logic everywhere)
- WooCommerce payment integration (Stripe, PayPal, any WC gateway)
- Deposit-aware WooCommerce checkout (charges deposit or remaining balance correctly)
- Mark Balance Paid / Mark Deposit Paid / Undo Deposit / Mark Refunded admin actions
- Auto-promote £0 bookings straight to paid
- Balance/refund indicator on the booking detail (red "Balance Due", green "Refund Due")
- Server-side cart price re-read from the database (anti-tampering)

## Invoicing & Finance
- Automatic invoice generation, attached as HTML to confirmation emails
- Updated invoice attached to all modification-approval emails
- Configurable bank/BACS details and payment terms on invoices
- Financial-year revenue tracking (April–March)
- Accounting export for Xero, Sage, and QuickBooks (CSV)
- CSV export of bookings

## Automated Payment Chasing
- Three-stage escalating reminder sequence (gentle → overdue → urgent)
- Deposit-balance reminders as the event approaches
- Configurable on/off, max chases, and interval between chases
- **B2B offline invoicing**: tiers flagged for BACS/PO suppress all "Pay Now" buttons, inject configurable BACS/PO instructions instead, and receive a single gentle statement reminder rather than the escalating chase

## Physical Access (Keysafe Codes)
- Automated "Access Details" email a configurable number of hours before the event
- Keysafe code plus admin-configurable health & safety notes
- Trust-based access gating: trusted tiers get the code at confirmed/deposit_paid/paid; standard hirers strictly when paid in full
- Access flag auto-reset on cancellation/refund (no stale codes)
- Manual "Send Access Details" admin button that bypasses all checks
- Codes never exposed in public REST payloads

## Scout Nights (Recurring Internal Bookings)
- Batch-create recurring weekly Scout section bookings (free, auto-confirmed)
- Dedicated admin page, separate from the public list
- Block public-calendar availability but excluded from revenue dashboards/counters
- Cancel Series (future only, preserves past)
- Reopen Series (restore future cancelled occurrences)
- Edit Series (bulk change time/space/section for future occurrences, conflicts skipped & reported)
- Extend Series (add weekly occurrences up to a new date, capped at 52 per run)
- Delete Series with choice of future-only or entire series (admin only)
- Per-row and per-series status display; cancelled rows badged

## Admin Dashboard & Management
- Bookings list with search, filter, and status tabs (Scout bookings excluded from counters)
- Editable booking details with live cost recalculation

- Auto-archive of past bookings (configurable threshold, daily cron)
- Pending-bookings notification badges on the menu

## Spaces & Conflict Architecture
- Parent/child space bundling (booking the "Whole HQ" locks the "Main Hall" and "Meeting Room", and vice versa)
